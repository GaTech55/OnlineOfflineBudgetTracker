## Description

The purpose of this app is to allow a user to track their budget. It allows them to enter deposits as well as enter expenses. Along with the ability to add new values they can be entered offline (stored in IndexedDB) and then uploaded to the database once internet service is restored. As the values are added the total and chart update with values.
